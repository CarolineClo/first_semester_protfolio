         <h3>Learning</h3>
         <p class=themeP>The purpose of this theme was to learn User Experience (UX) methods, how to present a product and how to communicate our research and test results to stakeholders. The product in question was an online shop selling t-shirts. The theme was broken down into three projects;</p> 
             <ul>   
                <li>03.01.01 Data Collection</li>   
                <li>03.02.01 Early Prototypes</li> 
                <li>03.03.01 Solution</li> 
            </ul>
        <h2><span>Data Collection</span></h2> 
            <p>In this project we learned how to conduct four types types of research; Desk research, observational research, interview research and survey research.</p><p>To do desk research is to analyse secondary data. We can use the results of other peoples research to get a broad understanding of a problem, trend or industry. I chose to research t-shirt trends and spent time online reading fashion and magazine blogs. I encountered one of the cons of desk research are that there are many sources out there and it’s easy to get sidetracked.
            </p><p>Osbservational research is research we do ourselves, directly for the people we are designing for. We observe a person or group in situ to discover habits or problems with existing design. I observed a class mate buy a t-shirt online, as this was important for our product. I learned a pro of this type of research is that  if you come up with something unexpected it’s difficult to ignore. My class mate had unexpectedly different shopping habits from my own, which showed me it’s important not to assume anything when doin research.</p><p>We conduct interview research to better understand a person and the decisions they make. I chose to interview someone who I know buys t-shirts regular online to find out more about our products potential users.</p><p>We use use surveys to collect specific information from a large group of people. It can be secondary or primary research depending on whether you conduct your own survey or use information from someone else’s. We did this section as a class together, I chose to focus on people who wore plain t-shirts and who commented on fit, as this tied in well with my previous research. </p>
        <h2><span>Early Prototypes</span></h2> 
            <p>The second project focused on getting from first ideas to early prototypes for the online t-shirt shop. This was a group project, and my group was formed with the common interest in body inclusivity and minimalistic style. We learned that the first step was sketching, which each team member did individually. We each created a crazy 8 sketch; 8 rough sketches, that forced us to quickly explore alternative ideas. Our abstract ideas became potential solutions when we shared them with each other and “dot voted” on some of our favourite sketches. This was then developed into a story board. Our collective research and initial sketching and voting highlighted a problem of not being able to find well fitting basic t-shirts for all body types.</p>

            </section>
            <p>A paper prototype is a sketch representing a digital website, and ours was detailed and interactive. We did this so as to get as much information as possible, to customise our solution quickly and easily before creating it on Adobe XD. While creating a low fidelity XD prototype for our shop, we learned about microcopy which are words and phrases in the user interface designed to guide or inform the user. This was missing in our prototype, so we added phrases such as “click here to shop” above buttons that lead to the shop.</p>
            <p>We learned another important testing tool is the think aloud test, the user goes through the site, and says out loud what they are doing and why they are making each decision as they navigate through the page. After these tests we decided to make the experience more tactile for the user, and aded more interactive features.</p>

        <h2><span>Solution</span></h2> 
            <p>Our solution was an online shopping experience, selling Classic T-shirts made of high quality, sustainable material with a focus on customisable sizing so every body type can find the perfect fit. We presented this via a high fidelity  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzLT6QRr1NA">XD Prototype</a> and a pitch of our product to our class and tutors.</p><p>Adobe XD is a useful tool and although I had used it in earlier projects, it was in this assignment that I got to learn the most about its potential and capabilities. I used it to create a tactile and interactive experience. Our users were creating a customisable product, so an immersive experience was used to make the immaterial become in a way physical. Furthermore it created a connection and trust to the product.</p>
