        <h3>Learning</h3>
        <p class=themeP>In Basic Web we learned how to build a website using HTML and CSS. We were also introduced to gestalt design principles and the psychology of design. Within this theme were three projects;</p> 
             <ul>   
                <li>02.01.01 Russian Constructivism</li>   
                <li> 02.02.01 History of the Micro Computer</li> 
                <li> 02.03.01 Interest-based Website</li> 
            </ul>
        <h2><span>Russian Constructivism</span></h2> 
            <p>In this project our goal was to create a page for mobile view, containing provided text and images which we were free to edit to fit our own design.</p>
        <h2>Design</h2> 
          
        <p>We were introduced to the concept of visual contrast and I used this through out my page, notably with the use of the colours red and black which I lifted from the source material. I designed an illustration which I placed in the header of the page, which demonstrates the figure-ground gestalt principle as text and shapes are layered on top of each other to create depth, and also a simple black rectangle uses the law of closure to create the illusion of shadow. I use the law of similarity in with the font style and size throughout the text, and also with background colours in the footer section.</p>

        </figure>
    </section>

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>We were introduced to VS code a programme which we go on to use throughout the semster. We were taught how to create a document with HTML and structure it’s content using semantic markup, which I used throughout to create headings and sub headings, p to separate paragraphs in the text, img to add a images and figcaption to add descriptive texts to these images.</p><p>We were also introduced to CSS which I used to style the page, for example I controlled the size the heading in my main section using h2{font-size: 5.5em} as it created impact and stood out as a heading. I also used css to apply font style, in this instance “Teko” a san serif which matched the Russian Constructivism design movement.</p>

    <h2><span>Interest-Based Website</span></h2>

    <p>In this project our goal was to create the design and User experience (UX) of a responsive website. I chose jewellery making as a the topic as it is a subject I know well, which has a lot of visual elements. I chose an Organic design style based on elements of nature.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    
    <p>We were introduced to mood boarding and I collected images which reflected the topic and the style. We also learned how to create a style tile, which I did in Adobe XD, containing the elements used in a project,  specifically; text, colour, texture and buttons.We learned how to use Adobe Illustrator to create buttons, I decided to create simple buttons in contrast to the decorative font which I chose to reflect organic style.</p>

    </section>
    <p>We were introduced to wire-framing utilising both hand sketching and Adobe XD. Within XD I used the Fibonacci spiral to create balance, and a symmetrical grid to create gravitas in areas where there is information and text. We also learned how to create a logo for our project, I decided to use a letterform logo with the first three letters of my last name. The logo is scalable, and simplistic and adaptable. </p>

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>We were introduced in this theme to the three components of responsive web design; Flexible grids, Flexible images and media queries. 

        I used flexible grids throughout the page, you can see an example of it on the home page. I decided to use grid display in the main section so I could control the layout in 2 dimensions. I then used flex display in one section to control the content as a single row of 3 columns.</p>
        
        <figure>
            <img id="gameStyletile" src="images/jewellery_grid.png" alt="grid display of jewellery website"><figcaption>Grid display on homepage.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        
        <p>I also made my images flexible by sizing them a percentage of their containers. Media queries is used to change the layout of a page when it is seen in different viewports. I added a number of media queries to my design, such as changing the aforementioned flex display to a block display when it is viewed in a mobile so the view changes to a single column of three sections which appear larger and easier to read. In an earlier project, The History of the Micro Computer, we were introduced to global navigation which we further explored in this project by adding an anchor element with an href we can guide the user throughout the website. I linked all of my pages using four links at the top of each page. Gestalts law of similarity shows that having the same global menu on every page will create a site which is easier to navigate.
        </p>

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>We were introduced to 5 second test, in which you show a user your page or logo for 5 seconds then ask some questions the purpose is to find insights into users initial reactions to your design. I created a 5 second test and asked users about the home page. The answers informed me that my navigation bar was user friendly. </p>
