         <h3>Learning</h3>
         <p class=themeP>The aim of this theme was to create a website for Freefridge Copenhagen and integrate video content as well as a new visual identity including logo, colour scheme and typography which should mostly appeal to pathos. The theme was split into 4 assignments;</p> 
             <ul>   
                <li>05.01.01 A story without words</li>   
                <li>05.02.02 Pre-production Part 1: Treatment</li> 
                <li>05.03.01 Pre-production part 2: Storyboard</li> 
                <li>05.03.02 Customer pitch</li>
            </ul>
<h2><span>A Story Without Words</span></h2> 
        <p>Before embarking on the main assignment, our first assignment was to create a one minute film with no words spoken or written, that communicates a story. I decided to film myself making some jewellery as it is could be potentially engaging content for a website.</p><p>We learned about the 5 shots: Closeup of the hands; which I achieved by using a small tripod low on my workbench; Closeup of the face, which I did film but ended up not including in the final film  as it took away from the jewellery making flow and also embarrassed me; Wide shot wide I included as book ends to the film; Over the shoulder, which I achieved with the use of a large tripod and Unusual/alternative which tried to achieve by attaching the camera to a coat hook.</p><p>We learned the basics in premier pro, how to import clips, edit them and add them to a film. This is how I manage to cut down 6 hours of handwork into one minute.</p>

<h2><span>Pre-production part 1: Treatment</span></h2>
        <p>In this project we learned about the importance of documentation. Especially when working in a team, it’s important every one is on the same page. To do this we started with a treatment;</p>
        <p>Title: The Helpers</p>  
        <p>Theme: Working Together, Apart</p>  
        <p>Logline</p> 
        <p>Four seemingly unconnected protagonists are going about certain jobs; A young man is cleaning a fridge, An older lady buys some vegetables, a woman picks up a box of food and loads it in a cargo bike, a family pack their car with food. The scenes cut back and forth between the different people on their journey. In the final scene we see they are all working towards a common goal: filling an empty fridge for Fælleskabet i København.</p>
        <p>The Treatment</p>
        <p>A fridge door is opened, the light reveals one item on the shelf which is taken and the fridge is closed. Cut to the next morning and a man is cleaning the fridge, cut to an older lady buying a perhaps a suspicious amount of reduced in price vegetables, cut to a woman picking up a box of produce from the back of a store and loading it into her cargo bike, cut to a family spilling out of their house and filling their car with bags of shopping. We follow these seemingly unconnected protagonists on their journey, cutting between each story: After buying the groceries, the lady heads off by foot. We cut to the family setting off in their car. Then cut to the feet of the cyclist, we see the shoes and trousers and background changing as the camera is fixed on the spinning pedals. She has made this journey multiple times before.</p><p>Cut to the family, they are making a stop to collect more food on their journey- someone passes them food on their doorstep. Cut to the man cleaning the fridge, he tightens a screw and checks the light. Cut to the cyclist the camera follows her, she passes the lady on foot and the camera follows her instead. She passes the family’s parked car. We see the cyclist parking her bike and lifting the box from the front. We cut back to the man and the fridge, he has finished his work and is walking away from the fridge, he waves to the approaching people; The family, older lady and bike lady, are arriving at the fridge. They begin to fill it with the food they have brought. They are happy and chatting to one another as they all help each other fill the fridge. It is revealed that the seemingly unconnected people have a common goal; filling this empty fridge with food. They are now connected. The final scene shows the fridge is full of produce, the camera slowly zooms out.</p><p>Throughout the film the following text is on the screen “Every year in Denmark 814,000 tons of edible food is wasted* at Freefridge København we want to make change. We make surplus food accessible for everyone for free in the heart of Nørrebro, tackling food waste and food insecurity. But we can’t do it alone…”</p><p>*Ministeriet for Fødevare Landbrug og Fiskeri 2021</p>

    <h2><span>Pre-production part 2: The Storyboard</span></h2>
         
        <p>n this assignment we learned about film language and how to apply it to a story board. Each shot is either a medium shot, a close up or a long shot or a variation of these. Every shot can be described using this language and every shot must have a transition into the next. We used film langugae to create a dramaturgical curve and  a <a href="images/Re-frigerate.storyboard.pdf">Storyboard</a> for our film.</p>

            <h2><span>Customer Pitch</span></h2>
    <p>The final assignment for the theme was to produce a <a href="https://vimeo.com/656959214">film</a> for content to the new <a href="http://faellesskabet.relcnob.com/">webpage</a>. We used design principles learned in pervious themes to create a website which is open, exciting and inviting. We created a logo which is scalable and fitted the client brief. We also created an easy to navigate global menu as we learned in basic web.</p>

    <p>We used skills learned in the first assignment of this theme to edit the film in Adobe premier pro.  We also used Adobe audition, a tool we were introduced to in basic animation, to add music, ambient noise and chatter to add to the emotion of the film.</p><p>We used research techniques and presentation techniques learned in basic UX to pitch our website to the client, class and tutors.</p>
